# Blab - Discord / Slack Clone
- Testing and learning React and Spring Integration

# Purpose
-
- Project starting July 30th 2018
- Learning to use react as a front end framework to serve
backend datat using RestAPI

# Technology
- BackEnd:
    - Java Spring serving Rest API for data interaction
    - Data storage via MySQL database  
- React w/ Redux:
    - Attempting to better understand react framework data structures.
- Accessing to Rest API built using Spring framework.


# Status
- Project Initially Planned


# ToDo
- Everything
- Determine models and repository structure for data backend (10%)
- Create data interaction via Rest API to React front end

#Setup

1. client:
    - `npm install` to install dependencies for react web app.
2. server: 
    Spring setup
    - Be sure to import the latest dependencies via `pom.xml`
    - Copy `example.properties` and rename it as `application.properties`
        - Be sure to modify the database connection information to match your system.
        - This has been tested using a MySQL database connection, although in theory this could be adapted to work with others
